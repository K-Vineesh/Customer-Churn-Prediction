## 📌 Overview

This project explores the prediction of customer churn in the telecom sector using various machine learning models. The study highlights the superior performance of the **Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HistGB)** model and an ensemble approach that boosts overall prediction accuracy.

---

## 🏆 Key Highlights

- Uses multiple machine learning models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Histogram-based Gradient Boosting
- Ensemble model achieves **96.39%** accuracy.
- HistGB model achieves a **ROC AUC of 99.49%**.
